Kadane's algorithm is used to find the maximum subarray sum within a given array of integers. The algorithm iterates through the array, keeping track of the maximum subarray sum found so far. It uses dynamic programming approach with a clever insight.

Here's how it works:

Initialization:
Initialize two variables, sum and max, to keep track of the current sum and the maximum subarray sum found so far.
sum is initialized to 0, and max is initialized to the smallest possible integer value (Integer.MIN_VALUE).
Iterating through the array:

Loop through each element of the input array nums.
For each element nums[i], update sum and max as follows:
Update sum to be the maximum of either the current element nums[i] itself or the sum of the previous subarray sum sum + nums[i]. This step is crucial because it determines whether to include the current element in the subarray or start a new subarray from the current element.
Update max to be the maximum of either the current sum or the previous max. This ensures that max always holds the maximum subarray sum found so far.

Return the maximum subarray sum:
After iterating through the entire array, return the value stored in max, which represents the maximum subarray sum found.
